# C4Evol
Comparative Genomics in Brassicaceae Family to understand C3-C4 intermediate evolution

The main steps in this pipeline are:
- Genome assembly (not included here)
- Gene annotation 
- Gene orthology detection and phylogenetic tree creation (with [Orthofinder](https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder))  
- Phylogenetic Association Mapping (PAM), associating orthogroups to changes in phenotype values (ccp:carbon compensation point), with phylogenetic correction.
- Orthogroup functional annotation
